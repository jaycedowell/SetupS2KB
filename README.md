SetupS2KB
---------
Setup S2KB started as simple command line utility written in IDL to help determine a pointing center for observation.  
It was originally intended to help deal with the problem of which way and how much to offset the telescope to find a 
suitable guide star.  However, it has evolved into a much more flexible tool that can be used both before observations 
begin to plan a field and during observations to help identify guide stars.
